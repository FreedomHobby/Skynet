tell Jonas to make changes

to get changes:
open Github Desktop, go to Repository -> Repository Settings and change "FreedomHobby" in the url that you see to "JonasMuhlenkamp" (it should initially look like "https://github.com/FreedomHobby/Skynet.git" and become "https://github.com/JonasMuhlenkamp/Skynet.git")
then click Fetch/Pull (same button, will need to click it twice)
then change the Repository Settings url that you changed before back to "https://github.com/FreedomHobby/Skynet.git"
